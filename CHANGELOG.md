## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `/vibe:backlog` now commits newly created backlog items automatically (single item, batch, or from a review) instead of leaving them uncommitted

## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- `/vibe:feature` and `/vibe:fix` now always commit modified files before ending their turn, no matter how the conversation unfolds (plan rejected, clarifying question, escalation), instead of only committing at the very end of a fully successful run — this prevents uncommitted work from being silently lost across `/clear` between sessions

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- `/vibe:feature` and `/vibe:fix` now actively check that tests written during implementation can't just pass no matter what (tautological tests), and `/vibe:review`'s test reviewer now hunts for and flags these tests more aggressively, always at high severity

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-09

### Changed

- `/vibe:feature` and `/vibe:fix` now fall back to the native `run-skill-generator` skill when `verify` fails 3 times purely on launch mechanics (build errors, crash on start) rather than on the behavior under test, before escalating to the user

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- `agents/review-tests.md` — test-suite review is now a first-class `/vibe:review` subagent that actually executes the project's test suite (including isolated e2e/integration runs) to ground findings in real pass/fail evidence, not just static reading

### Removed

- `/vibe:review-tests` standalone command — folded into `/vibe:review` (see Added)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- `/vibe:backlog` and `/vibe:feature` now detect when a request bundles several independent capabilities and propose splitting it into separate backlog items instead of one oversized task

### Changed

- `/vibe:feature` and `/vibe:fix` now delegate runtime verification to the native `verify` skill and adopt an adversarial "assume it's broken" posture, exercising the nominal path plus an edge case or error path for real instead of a single happy-path run

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Plugin manifest for the Claude Code marketplace, enabling installation via `/plugin marketplace add` + `/plugin install vibe`
- `/vibe:init` — initialize or regenerate a project's `CLAUDE.md` for vibe coding (TDD-first, automated QA, human as Product Owner only)
- `/vibe:backlog` — list or add feature backlog items
- `/vibe:feature` — implement a new feature using TDD
- `/vibe:fix` — fix a bug using TDD, reproducing it first
- `/vibe:review` — run a multi-agent code quality review covering architecture, complexity, DDD, dependencies, hygiene, naming, performance, robustness, security, and SOLID principles
- `/vibe:review-tests` — audit the test suite for coverage gaps and test quality
- `/vibe:review-web-security` — audit a web app for exploitable vulnerabilities
- `/vibe:sync` — generate and keep an internal codebase context map up to date
- `/vibe:changelog` — maintain `CHANGELOG.md` from git history
- `/vibe:docs` — generate and refresh README documentation and a `docs/` folder, including an index that keeps every doc file linked from the README
- `/vibe:release` — versioned release workflow (changelog finalization, docs refresh, version bump, commit and tag)
- A color-coded subagent status line shown in the agent panel during multi-agent reviews
- Installation instructions and an MIT license
