# /vibe:init — Vibe Coding CLAUDE.md Generator

You are about to initialize or fully regenerate this project's `CLAUDE.md` to support **vibe coding**: the user acts as Product Owner only and never manually tests code. All quality assurance must be automated.

## Step 1 — Project reconnaissance

Scan for manifest files — a project may use more than one stack:

| Stack | Manifest | Test framework | Style tooling |
|---|---|---|---|
| Node.js / TS | `package.json` | jest/vitest/mocha/tap/ava; `*.test.*`/`*.spec.*` | `@biomejs/biome`; or eslint + prettier |
| Python | `pyproject.toml`/`setup.py`/`requirements.txt` | pytest/unittest; `test_*.py` | `[tool.ruff]`/`ruff.toml`; or `[tool.black]` |
| Rust | `Cargo.toml` | built-in `cargo test` | built-in `rustfmt` |
| Go | `go.mod` | built-in `go test` | built-in `gofmt`/`goimports` |
| Java / Kotlin | `pom.xml`/`build.gradle` | junit/testng | checkstyle/spotless |
| PHP | `composer.json` | phpunit | php-cs-fixer/phpcs |
| Ruby | `Gemfile` | rspec/minitest | rubocop |
| .NET / C# | `*.csproj`/`*.sln` | xunit/nunit/mstest | built-in `dotnet format` |
| any | `Makefile` | check targets | check targets |

For each detected stack, read the manifest to extract:
- Project name and description
- Existing scripts for: test, lint, format, build, dev/run
- Declared dependencies

Also collect:
- Top-level directory structure (infer architecture)
- Existing `CLAUDE.md` — preserve sections marked `<!-- keep -->`
- `.env.example` or `.env`
- CI config files (`.github/workflows/`, etc.)
- `$ARGUMENTS` if provided — treat as additional project description

## Step 1b — Handle empty project

If Step 1 found **no manifest files at all** (truly empty project — no `package.json`, no `pyproject.toml`, no `Cargo.toml`, etc.):

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to collect the following before continuing:

1. **Project idea** — "Quel est le but de ce projet ? Décris brièvement ce que tu veux construire." (open text)
2. **Tech stack** — offer 4 options based on common choices, or let the user type their own:
   - Node.js / TypeScript
   - Python
   - Rust
   - Go

Save the answers and treat them as the project description for Step 4. Use the chosen stack to bootstrap a minimal project structure in Step 3 (create the manifest file for that stack so tooling can be installed).

If Step 1 found at least one manifest, skip this step entirely.

## Step 1c — Create task list

Based on what was found in Steps 1 and 1b, invoke the `vibe:tasks` skill (Skill tool) to create the tasks below. **Keep subject names short (≤ 30 chars)** — they appear in the status line. `vibe:tasks` creates the tasks via `TaskCreate`, or falls back to a scratchpad checklist if that tool is unavailable — either way, its instructions then govern how every later "Mark the task ... completed" instruction in this skill is carried out.

If the project is empty (Step 1b was triggered) **or** missing tooling was detected, pass this as `$ARGUMENTS`:

```
Bootstrap / install tooling      ← no dependency
Write CLAUDE.md                  ← blockedBy "Bootstrap / install tooling"
Run lint, tests, and vibe:sync   ← blockedBy "Write CLAUDE.md"
```

If no missing tooling and project already has a manifest, pass this instead:

```
Write CLAUDE.md                  ← no dependency
Run lint, tests, and vibe:sync   ← blockedBy "Write CLAUDE.md"
```

## Step 2 — Identify gaps

From the table above, flag any missing test framework or style tooling → install in Step 3.

Determine review agents to activate in CLAUDE.md:

- `vibe:review-tests`, `vibe:review-naming`, `vibe:review-complexity`, `vibe:review-security`, `vibe:review-dependencies`, `vibe:review-robustness`, `vibe:review-hygiene`, `vibe:review-antipatterns`, `vibe:review-simplicity`, `vibe:review-overengineering`: always active
- `vibe:review-solid`: activate if the project uses classes, interfaces, or a modular architecture; skip for scripts or functional code
- `vibe:review-ddd`: activate if an explicit domain layer exists (`domain/`, `entities/`, `aggregates/`, `value-objects/`, or equivalent DDD vocabulary); skip otherwise
- `vibe:review-architecture`: active if `.vibe/` exists (it will after Step 5 runs `/vibe:sync` — mark it active)
- `vibe:review-performance`: activate if the project type is API, server, or full-stack; skip for CLIs, libraries, and scripts
- `vibe:review-web-security` (deep web audit): activate if the project exposes HTTP endpoints (web app, API, SSR frontend); skip otherwise
- `vibe:review-pentest` (dynamic penetration test): activate if the project exposes a runnable networked application (web app, API, server) that can be launched and probed in a safe local environment; skip for libraries, static sites, and CLIs with no network surface
- `vibe:review-hexagonal`: activate if the project explicitly follows a hexagonal (ports & adapters) architecture — declared in an ADR or `CLAUDE.md`, or evident from a `ports/`/`adapters/` (or `driving/`/`driven/`) structure; skip otherwise — never impose hexagonal on a project that has not chosen it

## Step 3 — Bootstrap / install tooling

Mark the `Bootstrap / install tooling` task `in_progress` (skip if the task was not created).

**Empty project case (Step 1b was triggered):** create the minimal project scaffold for the chosen stack before installing tooling:

| Stack | Scaffold command |
|---|---|
| Node.js / TS | `npm init -y`, add `"type": "module"` to `package.json`, create `src/index.ts` |
| Python | `uv init` or create `pyproject.toml` + `src/<name>/__init__.py` |
| Rust | `cargo init` |
| Go | `go mod init <module-name>` + `main.go` |

Then install the canonical tooling for that stack (test framework + style tool), as described below.

**Existing project case:** only install what is missing. Prefer the canonical, modern tool for each stack:

| Stack | Test framework (if missing) | Style tooling (if missing) |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js / TS | Vitest — `npm i -D vitest`, add `"test": "vitest run"` to scripts | Biome — `npm i -D @biomejs/biome`, `npx biome init`, add `"lint": "biome check --write ."` |
| Python | Pytest — `pip install pytest` or add to `[project.optional-dependencies]` | Ruff — `pip install ruff`, add `[tool.ruff]` to pyproject.toml, `"lint": "ruff check --fix ."` |
| Rust | n/a (built-in) | n/a (`rustfmt` built-in — add `rustfmt.toml` if needed) |
| Go | n/a (built-in) | n/a (`gofmt` built-in) |
| Java | JUnit 5 via Maven/Gradle dependency | Spotless plugin |
| Ruby | RSpec — `bundle add rspec`, `rspec --init` | RuboCop — `bundle add rubocop`, `rubocop --auto-gen-config` |
| .NET | xUnit — `dotnet add package xunit` | n/a (`dotnet format` built-in) |
| PHP | PHPUnit — `composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit` | PHP-CS-Fixer — `composer require --dev friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer` |

After any install:
1. Create a minimal passing placeholder test to confirm the framework works
2. Run the lint command once to auto-fix any existing style issues
3. Confirm both commands exit with code 0 before continuing

Mark the task `completed`.

## Step 4 — Write CLAUDE.md

Mark the `Write CLAUDE.md` task `in_progress`.

Create or fully overwrite `CLAUDE.md` at the project root.
Populate every placeholder with values inferred from the actual project — no generic examples left behind.

Mark the task `completed`.

## Project overview

[1–3 sentences inferred from manifest description + $ARGUMENTS + user's answer from Step 1b (if empty project) + directory structure]

**Stack:** [actual detected stack, e.g. Python 3.12 / FastAPI / Pytest / Ruff]
**Type:** [CLI / REST API / frontend / library / full-stack / other]

## Architecture

[Brief description of top-level directories, inferred from actual structure]

```
[project-root]/
├── [dir]/   # [role]
├── [dir]/   # [role]
└── ...
```

<!-- The import below loads the compact codebase map into every session. It is maintained by /vibe:sync; details (modules/, models.md, glossary.md) stay on-demand. -->

## Development workflow (Vibe Coding)

The user is the **Product Owner only**. They describe requirements and evaluate outcomes — they do NOT write or manually test code.

### Definition of Done

A task is complete ONLY when ALL of the following are true:

- [ ] Implementation code is written
- [ ] Tests covering the nominal path exist and pass
- [ ] Tests covering edge cases and error paths exist and pass
- [ ] Lint exits with code 0 — style enforced by tooling (see manifest for command)
- [ ] All tests pass — run test command from manifest
- [ ] No debug artifacts left in code (console.log, print, dbg!, etc.)

**Never present a result to the user if tests are failing.**

### TDD workflow

For every feature or fix:

1. **Write tests first** — describe expected behavior through tests before writing implementation
2. **Confirm tests fail** — run the test command and verify new tests fail (red)
3. **Write implementation** — minimum code to make tests pass
4. **Confirm tests pass** — run the test command and verify all tests pass (green)
5. **Refactor if needed** — clean up while keeping tests green
6. **Run lint** — run the lint command and fix any issues
7. **Present result** — summarize what was done, what was tested, and the test output

### Bug fix workflow

1. **Reproduce in a test first** — write a failing test that captures the bug
2. Fix the bug
3. Confirm the test passes
4. Present result with the test name that now covers the bug

### Self-correction loop

If tests or lint fail:
- Do NOT ask the user for help
- Diagnose the failure, fix it, re-run
- Repeat until green (max 3 self-correction attempts)
- Only escalate to the user if the failure reveals an ambiguous requirement

## Testing conventions

- Test location: `[actual path inferred from project, e.g. tests/, __tests__/, src/**/*.test.ts]`
- Test runner: `[actual framework]`
- One test file per source module
- Test names must describe behavior: `"returns empty list when input is empty"` not `"works"`
- Always cover: happy path + at least 2 edge cases + error/invalid input

## Constraints

- Never leave dead code or unused imports
- Never hardcode secrets — use environment variables
- Never skip tests to meet a deadline — fix the code instead
- Style is enforced by tooling, not by convention — always run the lint command before presenting results

## Review agents

Agents active for `/vibe:review` on this project:

| Agent | Active | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `vibe:review-tests` | ✅ | always active |
| `vibe:review-naming` | ✅ | always active |
| `vibe:review-complexity` | ✅ | always active |
| `vibe:review-security` | ✅ | always active |
| `vibe:review-dependencies` | ✅ | always active |
| `vibe:review-robustness` | ✅ | always active |
| `vibe:review-hygiene` | ✅ | always active |
| `vibe:review-antipatterns` | ✅ | always active |
| `vibe:review-simplicity` | ✅ | always active |
| `vibe:review-overengineering` | ✅ | always active |
| `vibe:review-solid` | [✅ / ❌] | [active if OO or modular architecture detected / inactive: functional or scripting style] |
| `vibe:review-ddd` | [✅ / ❌] | [active if domain layer detected / inactive: no explicit domain model] |
| `vibe:review-architecture` | [✅ / ❌] | [active if `.vibe/` exists / inactive: run `/vibe:sync` first] |
| `vibe:review-performance` | [✅ / ❌] | [active if API/server/full-stack / inactive: CLI, library, or script] |
| `vibe:review-web-security` | [✅ / ❌] | [active if the project exposes HTTP endpoints / inactive: no HTTP surface] |
| `vibe:review-pentest` | [✅ / ❌] | [active if a runnable networked app can be probed locally / inactive: no runnable network surface] |
| `vibe:review-hexagonal` | [✅ / ❌] | [active if the project declares a hexagonal (ports & adapters) architecture / inactive: no such commitment] |
```

## Step 5 — Final confirmation

Mark the `Run lint, tests, and vibe:sync` task `in_progress`.

1. Run the lint command (from manifest) — auto-fix style across the codebase
2. Run the test command (from manifest) — confirm all tests pass
3. **Invoke the `vibe:sync` skill** using the Skill tool (`skill: "vibe:sync"`) — this generates the `.vibe/` directory with module map, data models, and glossary. Do NOT skip this step; the `.vibe/` folder must exist when `/vibe:init` completes — the CLAUDE.md written in Step 4 imports `@.vibe/index.md`, so verify that `.vibe/index.md` now exists.

Mark the task `completed`.

4. Report to the user (concise, no full CLAUDE.md dump unless asked):
   - Detected stack and project type
   - What was installed or configured (if anything)
   - Lint status + test status
   - One sentence describing what CLAUDE.md now enforces
   - Mention that `/vibe:docs` is available to generate project documentation (README managed sections + docs/)
